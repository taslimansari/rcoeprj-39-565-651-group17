# Pacman game

> **Abstract** : Creating a Pac-Man game project in Java involves designing the game's graphical interface and implementing its core mechanics. You'll need to handle user input for Pac-Man's movement and ghost behavior, manage game state, and use collision detection to track interactions between characters and collectibles. Additionally, you'll need to incorporate sound effects and scoring systems for a complete gaming experience.
